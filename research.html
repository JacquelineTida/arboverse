                                <h4>Arboviral diseases are infections transmitted by the bite of infected hematophagous arthropods. Arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Chikungunya and Zika disproportionately affect most vulnerable populations, causing hundreds of millions of cases annually and overwhelming health systems in tropical countries. Our work has been developing diagnostic assays based on serological and molecular approaches, including neglected arboviruses, such as Mayaro and the Oropouche virus. Since 2013, we have been characterized by the genomic diversity of ~50 arbovirus species from tropical regions of the Americas. Recently, we have implemented a framework based on a multi-omics approach to investigate mechanisms involved in arbovirus infections, such as fatal outcomes caused by the Chikungunya virus. Finally, we collaborated with experimental models of arboviruses infections, such as Mayaro, Chikungunya, and Zika. </h4>

                                <h4>Zoonotic viruses cause two-thirds of emerging infectious diseases globally, thousands of deaths annually, and a significant impact on public health and the economy. In this context, we have been combined metagenomics and bioinformatics approaches to discovered and characterized novel viruses (to date, over 100 ) in samples from rodents, bats, opossums, avian and ticks from South America, Africa and Antarctica. This framework has been combined with classical virological methods to identify the basic characteristics of these new viruses, such as frequency, distributions and tropism. Besides, we have been conducting studies of the evolutionary history of emerging viruses, including element viruses endogenous originated and integrated into animal genomes hundreds to millions of years ago.</h4>

                                <h4>During the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, we have been conducted several studies about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in Brazil. Based on large joint analyses of genomic and epidemiological data, we reported at least 100 international virus introductions in Brazil and uncovered temporal changes in the patterns of virus spread and transmission across the country. Also, we identified that socioeconomic disparities dictate access to COVID-19 diagnosis and that heterogeneously implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions impede epidemic control. In another study, we identified that low-income and Black and Pardo communities are more likely to die with COVID-19. In early 2021, we contributed to the identification of P.1 lineage that emerged in Manaus city. Subsequently, we showed that P.1 lineage might escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and chemically-inactivated vaccine.</h4>
